Here’s a one-page Git workflow cheat sheet for safely working with branches, editing, and pushing to a shared repository.

# Make sure you are in the directory with the files (should end in project3)


1️⃣ Update main safely
git checkout main        # Switch to main branch
git pull                 # Get latest changes from remote

✅ Always update main before creating a new branch


--- DO NOT EDIT THE MAIN BRANCH, ONLY THE CHECKED OUT BRANCH ---
2️⃣ Create your feature branch

git checkout -b my-feature-branch

# Now all edits are on this branch
# Main remains untouched


3️⃣ Make edits locally

# Edit files in VS Code
# Stage changes:

git add .   
    # Or click the "+" next to "Changes" (in GitHub "Source Control" menu)

# Commit changes with a message:
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"      
    # Or type a message in the box and click "Commit" (in GitHub "Source Control" menu)


4️⃣ Push your branch to GitHub

git push -u origin my-feature-branch

# First push creates the branch on GitHub
# Subsequent pushes just update it


6️⃣ Collaborate / Review

# Go to GitHub → your branch → “Pull Request”
    # Found under the dropdown with "Contribute"
# Team can review your changes
# Once approved, merge into main


7️⃣ Verify branch

git branch               # Shows all branches; * is current
git status               # Shows current branch & staged changes

# Confirms you’re editing the right branch


8️⃣ Branch tips / rules

# Never edit main directly
# Make a new branch for every feature/fix
# Commit often, push after meaningful changes
# Delete branches after merging to keep repo clean:

--- ONLY DELETE IF YOU ARE SURE CHANGES HAVE BEEN MERGED (updated & approved on the main) --- 
git branch -d my-feature-branch             # local, on my machine
git push origin --delete my-feature-branch  # remote, on the GitHub repository
